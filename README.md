This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to use the application

#### run 'npm install' on commandline
#### run 'npm start' to open the application on 'localhost:3000'


#### Features available

1.The application uses react-dnd to implement drag and drop functionality.

2.Initially it shows three widgets - chart Datasource, chart graph and notifications.

3.You can add a new widget of type datasource/graph by clicking on the circled + symbol at top right corner of the widget.

4.You can select the data source of any widget by using the dropdown at the top

5.You can change the datasource widget from which data is consumed on a graph by using the drop down at the title section of the graph.

6.A primitive functionality is implemented to make sure that widgets won't overlap with each other when a widget is dropped on top of another. This functionality needs improvement on calculating the positions correctly.

7.PWA has been implemented for desktop chrome . You can install the PWA by navigating the the hosted page on github [here](https://johnconnor31.github.io/workSpaceDashboard/) from chrome.

8.Resizing functionality for widgets needs to be implemented along with PWA for other browsers and mobile devices.
